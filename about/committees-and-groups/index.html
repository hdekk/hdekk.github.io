Expected outcomes include<br />
1) developing a connected and informed group,<br />
2) providing opportunities for professional development through
training, and<br />
3) collecting and creating tools and resources for all IASSIST
members to make use of (both IG members and non-members).<br />

<dd>The availability of health data about individuals, gathered from
surveys or health care systems, are an invaluable resource for
researchers who wish to examine interactions between individuals and
the healthcare they receive. In addition, there is now much more
demand for research and analysis of linked health and social data
(for example, health records linked with education or social
security records). Particular challenges face data professionals who
seek to acquire health, and linked health data. The IASSIST Health
Data Interest Group has been established to bring together data
practitioners and technicians who manage access to health, and
health-linked data for research purposes, in order to share
expertise and enable members to overcome challenges in their
day-to-day roles.<br />

<dd>This group focused on promoting a greater understanding of data
visualization &ndash; its creation, uses, and importance in research,
across disciplines. Data Visualization supports a means to make
sense of data, through visual representation, and to communicate
ideas and information effectively.<br />
<br />
Particular areas of focus and discussions included, but were not
limited to the following:</dd>
<dd><strong>·</strong> Enable opportunities for IASSIST members to learn and enhance
their skills in this growing field<br />
<strong>·</strong> Support a culture of best practice for data visualization
techniques; creation, use, and curation<br />
<strong>·</strong> Discussion of the relevant tools for all kinds of data
visualizations<br />
<strong>·</strong> Provide input and feedback on data visualization tools<br />
<strong>·</strong> Capture examples of data visualization to emulate and avoid<br />
<strong>·</strong> Explore opportunities for service development in libraries<br />
<strong>·</strong> Use of data visualization for allowing pre-analysis browsing
of data content in repositories<br />
<strong>·</strong> Be aware of and communicate to others the needs of researchers
in this field<br />
<strong>·</strong> Connect with communities of metadata developers and users to
gain better understanding of how metadata can enable better
visualization, and how in turn visualization need might drive
development of metadata standards<br /></dd>

<dt><strong>Open Source Interest Group (OSIG)</strong></dt>
<dd>Open source programming languages like R and Python are rapidly
transforming the landscape of data management and analysis. These
free tools offer similar and in some cases better functionality than
their commercial equivalents and simultaneously benefit from free
community support from a vast network of developers and users. This
interest group will provide a forum for IASSIST members to share
information on how to promote the use of open source languages by
those whose work we support as well as ways in which we might
contribute back to the open source community.<br /></dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Data Management &amp; Curation Interest Group (SIGDMC)</strong></p>

<p>This interest group focused on issues related to research data
management and curation, in order to support members&rsquo; work in this
field. Sound data management and curation strategies ensure that
research data will be available for sharing, dissemination and reuse
over time. These strategies are not only important for data
preservation, but, in a growing number of countries, a necessity for
research groups in order to receive funding.<br />
<br />
The role and function of the data management and curation interest group
included but was not limited to the following:</p>

<p><strong>·</strong> Maintain an <a href="/resources/category/data-management-and-curation">inventory of materials, resources, and
policies</a> related to
sound data management and curation internationally<br />
<strong>·</strong> Enable opportunities for IASSIST members to learn and enhance
their skills in this field<br />
<strong>·</strong> Foster information-sharing among IASSIST members of their work in
this area at their institutions<br />
<strong>·</strong> Maintain awareness of data management and curation issues
internationally across<br />
  disciplines, including beyond the social sciences<br />
<strong>·</strong> Seek opportunities for outreach and advocacy on issues related to
data management,<br />
  including to organizations with similar missions<br />
<strong>·</strong> Examine issues related to collaborative ventures with research
groups<br />
<strong>·</strong> Provide input and feedback on data curation tools</p>

<dt><strong><a href="https://iassistdata.org/community/sigdc">Data Citation Interest Group</a> (SIGDC)</strong></dt>
<dd>This interest group seeked to promote awareness of data-related
research and scholarship through data citation. Citing data supports
the discovery and reuse of data, leading to better science through
the validation of results. It also recognizes data as an essential
part of the scientific record.</dd>
