                          <p>Meeting of the General Assembly, Thursday, May 17, 2007, Montréal,
Québec, Canada</p>

<ol>
<li>Welcome E Boyko, President
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</li>
</ol>

<p>The meeting was called to order at 12:59 with about 190 persons present.</p>

<p>E Boyko expressed thanks to the Local Arrangements Committee, ledt by
Anastassia Khouri and Susan Czarnocki, and the Program Committee, led by
Suzette Giles and Louise Corti.</p>

<p>He explained that in addition to its constitutional functions, the

does, and encouraged newcomers to get involved in its activities.</p>

</ol>

<p>President &amp; Vice-president - E Boyko &amp; M Wright</p>

<p>E Boyko reported that he has intervened very little in the actual
running of the association, but has mainly spent his energies on
representing the interests of it. M. Wright noted a forthcoming call for
proposals for funding of projects that further the objectives of the
IASSIST Strategic Plan. Allocated funds in 2006-2007 sent two IASSIST
members to the CODATA conference in Beijing.</p>

<p>Treasurer - J Green</p>

<p>J Green thanked the assistant treasurers R Boily and S Macdonald. The
association has three sets of accounts in three countries. A
diagrammatic overview of the distribution of the funds was presented.
The association has 3 times the annual operating budget in the bank, and
is in a healthy financial position. As well, the association has some
long term investments. Last year\&rsquo;s expenditures were over budget. A
large portion of association revenues are from membership fees; these
fees are returned to the membership in the form of for example the
IASSIST Quarterly and the listserv. The budget for the coming year is
balanced.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reports of Regional Secretaries
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</li>

operating in Queensland, Sydney, etc. Have also received a large grant
to set up historical census statistics for web access. Will also be
improving the qualitative archive, and embarking on a pilot project on
preservation.</p>

<p>ACSPRI organized the first Australian methodology conference. A National
Data Network (NADA) has been formed out of the Australian Statistical
Office. New Zealand is organizing a new data archive, in Auckland. The
full regional report will be available on the association web site.</p>

<p>Canada - B Wandschneider</p>

<p>The Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) is another year older, and has been
focusing on training programs. The full report for the region will be
posted on the web site in a week or so. There have been a number of
collaborative projects, especially DDI projects, in Canada, some in the
form of partnerships between Statistics Canada and academia, especially
to do with standards and best practices.</p>

<p>Members were also encouraged to try out the membership database.</p>

<p>Europe - M Kleemola</p>

<p>Reported briefly on highlights: lots of projects and organizational
changes - some connections to IASSIST, via ESS and CESSDA. The European
Social Survey (ESS) data will be available this autumn. The full report
will be made available on the web.</p>

<p>USA &ndash; P Baxter</p>

<p>The full report will be made available on the association web server, in
English and French. P Baxter recognized Peggy Adams who has been named a
fellow of the Society of American Archivists. The Roper Center has

Data-PASS project, as well as in another project with NARA.</p>

<p>Africa - E. Boyko</p>

<p>In the last IASSIST election, no candidate was nominated for African
secretariate. In consultation with the African attendees at this
conference, the administration is appointing K Kosozi, Ugandan Bureau of
Statistics, as the new African secretariate, drawing on the help of Y
Seid. The association is looking forward to increased activity in
Africa.</p>

Lois Timms-Ferrara.</p>

<p>Ms Neidert also stepping down as chair of the Publications Committee.
Chair is really only an umbrella role; the important work of the
committee is directed by KB Rasmussen, R Rice, and S Cannon.</p>

<p>KB Rasmussen - publication of the IQ is one year behind, but that\&rsquo;s
good, because we have been even farther behind. All presenters were
urged to submit their presentations.</p>

<p>R Rice - her function is as web site editor, largely a volunteer
coordinator role. Highlights of the past year: membership section up to
date, posting minutes and new officers, revised flyer. New FAQ for
members. Several sections: membership, conferences, working on IQ
citations back to beginning, also scanned back issues. Working with the
membership database to harvest member institutions web sites. Wants more
input from members to share documentation eg training materials, other
